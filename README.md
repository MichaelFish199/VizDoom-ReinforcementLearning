# VizDoom-ReinforcementLearning
Creating agent that can play VizDoom using stablebaselines3.

This repository consists of 4 jupyter notebooks where agents are trained to kill enemies in different environments:
  - VizDoom-Basic.ipynb where agent can move left or right and shoot (enemy spawn in front of him),
  - VizDoom-DefendTheCenter.ipynb where agent can only aim and shoot (enemies spawn around him),
  - VizDoom-DefendTheLine.ipynb where agent can move left or right and shoot (enemies spawn in front of him),
  - VizDoom-DeadlyCorridor.ipynb where agent can do anythink but has to reach end of corridor (enemies are at the sides)
